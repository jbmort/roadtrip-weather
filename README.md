# Roadtrip

The purpose of this project is to create a program that can show a user an optimal route between two points of their choosing and show what the weather will be like at points along their route at the approximate time they will arrive to that point in their roadtrip.

This program will be helpful to anyone who is planning to take a long roadtrip. Especially if that roadtrip crosses into different climates/ regions than their starting point. This will help with planning for weather changes allong the route and what conditions will be like at their destination. 

This project utilizes the services of Open Street Maps, Open Routes, and Open Meteo. The data recieved from each of these services is brought together in a map created using Open Layers.
